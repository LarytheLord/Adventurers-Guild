## Overview

The Adventurers Guild is an educational platform that gamifies computer science learning by connecting students with real-world projects from companies. Students (called "Adventurers") progress through skill trees, earn experience points (XP), and advance through a ranking system (F to S rank) by completing "Quests" - which are actual digital projects commissioned by companies.
