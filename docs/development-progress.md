# Adventurers Guild - Development Progress Summary

## Authentication System Improvements

### Completed Work:
1. **Fixed Server-Side Supabase Client Implementation**
   - Properly implemented `createServerSupabaseClient` using `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`
   - This ensures better session handling on the server side

2. **Enhanced Authentication Utilities**
   - Created `lib/authUtils.ts` with helper functions for dashboard routing and rank test completion
   - Centralized logic for determining user dashboard paths based on roles

3. **Improved Role-Based Routing**
   - Updated middleware with proper role-based access control
   - Added support for the new 'client' role
   - Enhanced redirect logic to send users to appropriate dashboards

4. **Created Custom Authentication Hook**
   - `hooks/useAuthRedirect.ts` for client-side authentication redirects
   - Handles both authentication requirements and rank test requirements

5. **Protected Route Handler for API Routes**
   - `lib/protectedRouteHandler.ts` provides utilities for protecting API endpoints
   - `withRoleProtection` higher-order function for easy API route protection
   - Automatic session and profile validation

6. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the authentication system in `docs/authentication.md`

### Files Modified:
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Fixed server client implementation
- `app/auth/callback/page.tsx` - Updated to use new utility functions
- `middleware.ts` - Enhanced role-based routing
- `lib/authUtils.ts` - New utility functions
- `hooks/useAuthRedirect.ts` - New custom hook
- `lib/protectedRouteHandler.ts` - New protected route utilities
- `docs/authentication.md` - Documentation

## Database Schema Updates

### Completed Work:
1. **Added 'client' role to user_role enum**
2. **Created comprehensive schema with policies and triggers**
3. **Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables**
4. **Created business logic functions and triggers**
5. **Added storage bucket policies documentation**

### Files Created:
- `supabase-schema-complete.sql` - Complete schema with all policies
- `supabase/reset_database.sql` - Script to completely reset database
- `supabase/migrations/20250827000000_add_client_role.sql` - Migration for client role
- `supabase/migrations/20250827000001_update_schema.sql` - Schema update migration
- `supabase/seed/seed_data.sql` - Initial seed data for skills and categories

## Deployment Documentation

### Completed Work:
1. **Created comprehensive deployment guide**
2. **Documented all environment variables**
3. **Provided step-by-step deployment instructions**
4. **Included troubleshooting section**

### Files Created:
- `docs/deployment.md` - Complete deployment guide

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Database Reset and Rebuild
To completely reset and rebuild your database:

1. Run the reset script: `supabase/reset_database.sql`
2. Apply the full schema: `supabase-schema.sql` (updated version)
3. Seed the database: `supabase/seed/seed_data.sql`

### 2. Configure Supabase Dashboard
- Set up OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Create storage buckets (avatars, quest-files)
- Configure email settings (SMTP)

### 3. Update Vercel Environment Variables
Ensure all environment variables are set in your Vercel project

### 4. Redeploy Application
Trigger a new deployment in Vercel
