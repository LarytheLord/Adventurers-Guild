# Contributing to The Adventurers Guild

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help is essential for making the guild a legendary place for developers. All contributions are welcome, from fixing a typo to implementing a major new feature.

This document is the Guild's official charter for new adventurers. It outlines how you can find a quest and submit your work for review.

## Finding a Quest

The first step on your adventure is to find a quest that suits your skills. All available quests are listed on our **[GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/your-username/adventurers-guild-website/issues)**.

We use labels to categorize quests by difficulty and type:

*   **E-Rank (good first issue):** Perfect for new adventurers! These are simple, well-defined tasks that are a great way to learn the codebase.
*   **D-Rank (help wanted):** These are a bit more involved but are still great for those looking to make a meaningful contribution.
*   **C-Rank (feature):** A request to build a new feature for the guild.
*   **B-Rank (bug):** A known issue or a gremlin in the code that needs to be squashed.
*   **A-Rank (refactor):** A quest to improve the structure or performance of existing code.
*   **S-Rank (epic):** A major, complex quest that may require significant effort and planning.

Before starting a quest, please leave a comment on the issue to let the guild masters (maintainers) know you're taking it on. This prevents multiple adventurers from working on the same quest.

## The Forging Process (Your Development Workflow)

Once you've chosen a quest, it's time to begin your work.

### 1. Claim Your Quest (Fork & Clone)

First, you'll need your own copy of the guild's archives (the repository).

*   **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
*   **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adventurers-guild-website.git
    cd adventurers-guild-website
    ```

### 2. Prepare Your Tools (Installation)

The guild uses `pnpm` for managing dependencies. Prepare your development environment with a single command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all the necessary tools and libraries for the project.

### 2.1. Set Up Environment Variables (Email & API Keys)

The guild's email system requires SMTP configuration. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# SMTP Configuration for Email Sending
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://adventurersguild.vercel.app
```

#### Gmail SMTP Setup (Recommended):

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and generate a 16-character password
   - Use this password in `SMTP_PASS` (not your regular Gmail password)
3. **Update `.env.local`** with your credentials

#### Alternative Email Providers:

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

**Yahoo:**
```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

#### Security Notes:
- ⚠️ **Never commit `.env.local` to Git** (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- Use app passwords instead of regular passwords
- For production, consider services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES

#### Testing Email Functionality:
1. Update `.env.local` with real email credentials
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Go to the waitlist section and test the email form
4. Check your inbox for the welcome email

### 3. Create a Quest Branch

Never work directly on the `main` branch. Create a new branch specifically for your quest. This keeps the archives clean and makes your work easier to review.

Choose a descriptive branch name, like:
`feature/add-quest-filters` or `fix/header-alignment-bug`

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### 4. Ignite the Forge (Run the Dev Server)

Now you're ready to start the local development server and see the website in action.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the website on `http://localhost:3000`. The server will automatically reload as you make changes to the code.

### 5. Craft Your Solution

This is where you work your magic! Write the code to complete your quest.

*   Follow the existing code style and conventions.
*   Keep your code clean, readable, and add comments for any complex logic.
*   Ensure the website runs without errors after your changes.

### 6. Submit Your Work for Review (Open a Pull Request)

Once your quest is complete, it's time to submit your work to the guild for review.

*   **Commit** your changes with a clear and descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add filtering to the quest board"
    ```
*   **Push** your branch to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin your-branch-name
    ```
*   **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your fork to the `main` branch of the original repository.

In your PR description, please include:
*   A link to the issue/quest you are solving (e.g., "Closes #42").
*   A clear description of the changes you made.
*   Any screenshots or GIFs that demonstrate your work, if applicable.

A guild master will review your PR, provide feedback, and, once approved, merge your contribution into the main codebase. Congratulations, adventurer—your legend grows!
Guild Master will be actively developing the site together with members.
