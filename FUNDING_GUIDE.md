# FUNDING GUIDE — How to raise early startup funding (2025)

**Purpose:** This guide helps founders of an unknown/early-stage startup gather funds using modern and traditional approaches, focusing on early validation, traction, and pragmatic use of funding tools.

## TL;DR
- Start small and prove traction before asking for large checks.  
- Use agile funding instruments (e.g., SeedFAST) or micro-instruments to buy time. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Use investor-matching platforms (e.g., FundTQ, AngelList, OpenVC) to find targeted investors and improve outreach. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Explore government/incubator funding (e.g., Startup India Seed Fund Scheme) for non-dilutive or early proof-of-concept funding. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 1. Recommended funding strategies (high level)

### 1.1 Agile / incremental funding (SeedFAST & similar)
- Raise smaller amounts ahead of a formal valuation using instruments like a SeedFAST (advance subscription-style instrument). This is useful for bridge capital and early validation without fixing valuation immediately. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 1.2 Targeted investor discovery & pitch tools
- Platforms that provide investor matchmaking, valuation tools, and pitch templates can accelerate introductions and improve your pitch quality (e.g., FundTQ, AngelList, OpenVC). Use these to shortlist investors who fit your sector and stage. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### 1.3 Micro VCs, syndicates & angels
- Target micro-VCs, angel networks, and syndicates that specialise in pre-revenue or pre-product startups — they often invest smaller cheques and provide hands-on mentorship.

### 1.4 Hybrid models & revenue-share
- Consider flexible structures that mix small equity stakes with revenue-share or convertible notes (where acceptable to investors) to preserve runway while aligning incentives.

### 1.5 Grants & incubators (government & university)
- Explore grant schemes and incubator seed funds (e.g., Startup India Seed Fund Scheme) for non-dilutive support, mentorship, and infrastructure. These programs often have application windows and eligibility criteria. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 3. Step-by-step process (practical)

### Step 0 — focus & validation (1–4 weeks)
- Define the smallest meaningful metric of traction (first 10 paying customers, pilot contract, 100 active users, etc.).  
- Build a one-pager and a very short pitch deck (6–10 slides) focusing on problem → traction → business model.

### Step 1 — prepare docs & data room (1–2 weeks)
Required items:
- One-pager (summary).  
- Pitch deck (6–10 slides).  
- 12–24 month financial model (basic projections).  
- Cap table (current & post-raise scenarios).  
- Demo or pilot evidence (screenshots, data).  
- Term sheet checklist / legal checklist.  
Keep files in a simple data room (Google Drive / Notion / Dropbox) and keep access logs.

### Step 2 — choose funding route & target list (1 week)
- Decide: SeedFAST / convertible / angel syndicate / grant / crowdfunding.  
- Use FundTQ / AngelList / OpenVC to create a targeted investor short-list. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

### Step 3 — outreach & conversion (2–6 weeks)
- Send a short, targeted intro email + one-pager (follow-up in 3–5 days). Automate tracking with a simple CRM (Airtable, Notion, HubSpot free).  
- If platform allows pitch submission, use their analytics (open rates, time on deck) to refine follow-ups.

### Step 4 — due diligence & term negotiation
- Expect basic DD (team background, incorporation docs, cap table, financials). Keep answers short and evidence-based.  
- Negotiate simple, founder-friendly terms: focus on alignment (mentorship, follow-on rights) over cheque size where helpful.

### Step 5 — close & post-close
- Use a lawyer or a templated legal platform (SeedLegals type) for docs. After close: update cap table, issue stock options where needed, and deposit funds into corporate account with clear bookkeeping.

## 4. Practical templates & checklists (copy & reuse)
- **Pitch email (subject)**: `Intro — <startup name>: traction → ask (5–10k/20k/50k)`  
- **PR deck structure**: Problem → Market → Solution → Traction → Business model → Team → Ask & use of funds  
- **Data room checklist**: Incorporation docs, shareholder agreements, cap table, financials, major contracts, IP assignments, team resumes

## 5. Tips for first-time founders
- Start with small, achievable asks and increase as you show traction.  
- Prioritise investor fit (sector, stage, mentoring style) over cheque size.  
- Keep records tidy and transparent — it speeds due diligence and builds trust.  
- Be ready to iterate quickly on the deck after every investor call.  
- Use government/incubator routes for early non-dilutive runway if eligible. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## 7. Concluding notes
- This guide is tactical: choose one path (grants / SeedFAST / angels) and execute — don't try to run all routes at once.  
- If you want, we can produce: a short 1-page checklist PDF, a sample 6-slide deck, and an outreach email template tailored to your sector.
