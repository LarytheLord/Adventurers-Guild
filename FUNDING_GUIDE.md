# FUNDING GUIDE — How to raise early startup funding (2025)

**Purpose:** This guide helps founders of an unknown/early-stage startup gather funds using modern and traditional approaches, focusing on early validation, traction, and pragmatic use of funding tools.

## TL;DR
- Start small and prove traction before asking for large checks.  
- Use agile funding instruments (e.g., [SeedFAST](https://seedlegals.com/seedfast/)) or micro-instruments to buy time.  
- Use investor-matching platforms (e.g., [FundTQ](https://fundtq.com), [AngelList](https://angel.co), [OpenVC](https://open.vc)) to find targeted investors and improve outreach.  
- Explore government/incubator funding (e.g., [Startup India Seed Fund Scheme](https://www.startupindia.gov.in)) for non-dilutive or early proof-of-concept funding.

## 1. Recommended funding strategies (high level)

### 1.1 Agile / incremental funding (SeedFAST & similar)
- Raise smaller amounts ahead of a formal valuation using instruments like a SeedFAST (advance subscription-style instrument). This is useful for bridge capital and early validation without fixing valuation immediately.

### 1.2 Targeted investor discovery & pitch tools
- Platforms that provide investor matchmaking, valuation tools, and pitch templates can accelerate introductions and improve your pitch quality (e.g., [FundTQ](https://fundtq.com), [AngelList](https://angel.co), [OpenVC](https://open.vc)). Use these to shortlist investors who fit your sector and stage.

### 1.3 Micro VCs, syndicates & angels
- Target micro-VCs, angel networks, and syndicates that specialise in pre-revenue or pre-product startups — they often invest smaller cheques and provide hands-on mentorship.

### 1.4 Hybrid models & revenue-share
- Consider flexible structures that mix small equity stakes with revenue-share or convertible notes (where acceptable to investors) to preserve runway while aligning incentives.

### 1.5 Grants & incubators (government & university)
- Explore grant schemes and incubator seed funds (e.g., [Startup India Seed Fund Scheme](https://www.startupindia.gov.in)) for non-dilutive support, mentorship, and infrastructure. These programs often have application windows and eligibility criteria.

## 3. Step-by-step process (practical)

### Step 0 — focus & validation (1–4 weeks)
- Define the smallest meaningful metric of traction (first 10 paying customers, pilot contract, 100 active users, etc.).  
- Build a one-pager and a very short pitch deck (6–10 slides) focusing on problem → traction → business model.

### Step 1 — prepare docs & data room (1–2 weeks)
Required items:
- One-pager (summary).  
- Pitch deck (6–10 slides).  
- 12–24 month financial model (basic projections).  
- Cap table (current & post-raise scenarios).  
- Demo or pilot evidence (screenshots, data).  
- Term sheet checklist / legal checklist.  
Keep files in a simple data room (Google Drive / Notion / Dropbox) and keep access logs.

### Step 2 — choose funding route & target list (1 week)
- Decide: SeedFAST / convertible / angel syndicate / grant / crowdfunding.  
- Use [FundTQ](https://fundtq.com), [AngelList](https://angel.co), [OpenVC](https://open.vc) to create a targeted investor short-list.

### Step 3 — outreach & conversion (2–6 weeks)
- Send a short, targeted intro email + one-pager (follow-up in 3–5 days). Automate tracking with a simple CRM (Airtable, Notion, HubSpot free).  
- If platform allows pitch submission, use their analytics (open rates, time on deck) to refine follow-ups.

### Step 4 — due diligence & term negotiation
- Expect basic DD (team background, incorporation docs, cap table, financials). Keep answers short and evidence-based.  
- Negotiate simple, founder-friendly terms: focus on alignment (mentorship, follow-on rights) over cheque size where helpful.

### Step 5 — close & post-close
- Use a lawyer or a templated legal platform ([SeedLegals](https://seedlegals.com) type) for docs. After close: update cap table, issue stock options where needed, and deposit funds into corporate account with clear bookkeeping.

## 4. Practical templates & checklists (copy & reuse)
- **Pitch email (subject)**: `Intro — <startup name>: traction → ask (5–10k/20k/50k)`  
- **PR deck structure**: Problem → Market → Solution → Traction → Business model → Team → Ask & use of funds  
- **Data room checklist**: Incorporation docs, shareholder agreements, cap table, financials, major contracts, IP assignments, team resumes

## 5. Tips for first-time founders
- Start with small, achievable asks and increase as you show traction.  
- Prioritise investor fit (sector, stage, mentoring style) over cheque size.  
- Keep records tidy and transparent — it speeds due diligence and builds trust.  
- Be ready to iterate quickly on the deck after every investor call.  
- Use government/incubator routes for early non-dilutive runway if eligible.

## 7. Concluding notes
- This guide is tactical: choose one path (grants / SeedFAST / angels) and execute — don't try to run all routes at once.  
- If you want, we can produce: a short 1-page checklist PDF, a sample 6-slide deck, and an outreach email template tailored to your sector.
