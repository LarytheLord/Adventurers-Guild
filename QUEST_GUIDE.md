Embark on a Quest with The Adventurers Guild!
Welcome, brave pioneers! We are The Adventurers Guild, a gamified open-source platform transforming Computer Science education. Our adventurers are future tech leaders who tackle real-world challenges to gain experience (XP), level up, and prove their skills.

This guide explains how you can post a "Quest" (a project or task) for our guild to conquer.

What is a Quest?
A quest is a well-defined project, task, or problem that you need solved. Submitting a quest gives our adventurers a chance to apply their skills to real-world challenges.

Examples of great quests include:

Analysis & Reports: "Analyze our user engagement data to identify key features for the next patch."

Design & Prototyping: "Forge a high-fidelity mockup for a new leaderboard system."

Development Tasks: "Build and document a new API endpoint for user authentication."

Consultation: "Review our technical roadmap for potential challenges and opportunities."

How to Submit a Quest
Submitting a quest is simple. Following these steps ensures we have all the intel needed to embark on your adventure right away.

Copy the Template: Copy the Quest Submission Form template at the bottom of this document.

Post the Bounty: Go to our GitHub Issues page, which serves as our official Quest Board: [Link to your Guild's GitHub Issues Page].

Fill Out the Scroll: Paste the template into a new issue and fill out all the details. The more information you provide, the faster our adventurers can get started!

Submit: Assign the tag/label quest-submission and submit the issue.

What to Expect After You Submit
Initial Scouting: Our Quest Master will review your submission for clarity and completeness within [e.g., 48 hours].

Assembly & Prioritization: The quest will be presented to the guild and prioritized based on its challenge, impact, and our available adventurers.

Party Formation: A party of adventurers will be assigned to your quest. Their leader will reach out to confirm the scope, objectives, and timeline.

The Journey: You can track the quest's progress and see updates directly in the GitHub issue.

Quest Complete!: We'll notify you upon completion and deliver all the spoils (code, designs, reports, etc.) and documentation.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: What if my quest is urgent?
A: Please flag it as 'Urgent' in the title and explain the deadline and impact in the description. We will do our best to assemble a party for critical quests.

Q: Can I talk to someone before submitting a quest?
A: Absolutely! If you're unsure about the scope or want to brainstorm, please reach out to our Quest Master, [Quest Master's Name or Title, e.g., Lead Maintainer], or post in our Discord channel: [#quest-help on your Discord Server].

Q: What if I don't have all the details for the form?
A: No problem. A map with a few landmarks is better than no map at all! Fill out what you can, and our adventurers can help scout the rest during the party formation phase.
