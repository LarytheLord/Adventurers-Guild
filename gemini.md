The Adventurers Guild: Complete Website Development Plan üó∫Ô∏è
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing "The Adventurers Guild" website, encompassing all necessary features, pages, technical details, and future additions to create a complete and impactful platform. This plan builds upon the current progress (waitlist page ready, homepage in progress) and aims to detail everything needed for a successful launch and continuous development.

1. Project Overview & Vision ‚ú®
The Adventurers Guild is a groundbreaking platform designed to gamify computer science education and bridge the gap between academic learning and industry demands. We transform aspiring developers ("Adventurers") into industry-ready problem-solvers by connecting them with real-world "Quests" (commissioned projects) from companies. Our vision is to establish a new standard for skill development, portfolio building, and talent sourcing in the tech industry.

2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope & Core Features üöÄ
The MVP focuses on proving the core value proposition: connecting Adventurers with Quests and demonstrating skill progression.

MVP Core Features:
User Authentication: Secure sign-up/sign-in for Adventurers and Quest Givers.

User Profiles: Basic profiles for both Adventurers (skills, bio, XP, rank) and Quest Givers (company info).

Quest Board: A browsable list of "Quests" posted by Quest Givers.

Quest Creation (Quest Giver): Ability for Quest Givers to post new project briefs.

Quest Application (Adventurer): Ability for Adventurers to apply for open Quests.

Basic XP & Rank System: Automatic XP gain upon Quest completion, and visible rank progression (F-S).

Simple Submission & Review: Adventurers submit work (e.g., GitHub link), Quest Givers review and approve.

Dashboard Views: Separate basic dashboards for Adventurers (their Quests, XP) and Quest Givers (their posted Quests, applicants).

3. Future Features & Additions (Post-MVP) üåü
To make the platform truly complete and scalable, the following features will be added iteratively after the MVP.

Enhanced Gamification & Progression:
Detailed Adventurer Dashboards: In-depth analytics on skill growth, quest statistics, success rates.

Skill Trees/Badges: Visual representation of mastered skills and achievements.

Leaderboards: Public/private rankings of Adventurers by XP, completed quests, or specific skills.

Mentorship System: Dedicated features for higher-ranked Adventurers to mentor lower ranks, with mentor profiles and tracking.

Community Forums/Guilds: Integrated forum or internal communication tools beyond Discord for persistent discussions and team formation.

Certifications/Micro-credentials: Guild-issued verifiable certifications for specific skill sets or Quest Lines.

Advanced Quest Management:
Automated Quest Matching: AI/ML-driven algorithms to suggest Quests to Adventurers based on skills, rank, and preferences.

Team Formation Tools: Integrated features for Adventurers to form teams for larger Quests, manage roles, and communicate.

Project Management Tools: Basic integrated PM tools (task assignment, deadlines, progress tracking) for active Quests.

Dispute Resolution System: A structured process for resolving disagreements between Adventurers and Quest Givers.

Payment Gateway Integration: Direct payment processing for commissioned Quests within the platform.

Content & Learning Resources:
Learning Paths: Curated "Quest Lines" or learning paths for specific technologies (e.g., "Full-Stack React Quest Line").

Knowledge Base: A repository of tutorials, best practices, and technical guides.

Code Sandbox/IDE Integration: In-browser coding environments for smaller training quests.

4. Technical Stack (Detailed) üíª
Frontend:
Framework: Next.js (React) for modern web development, supporting both static site generation (marketing pages) and server-side rendering (dynamic dashboards).

Icon Library: Lucide React or React Icons for scalable vector icons.

Charting: Recharts or similar library for displaying XP progression, quest statistics, etc.

Backend:
Architecture: Serverless Functions (e.g., Next.js API Routes, Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda) for scalability and cost-efficiency.

Language: Node.js with Express.js (if a dedicated backend service is preferred over serverless functions for complex logic).

Authentication: NextAuth.js for handling OAuth (Google, GitHub) and email/password authentication securely.

API Layer: RESTful API endpoints for data interaction between frontend and database.

Database:
Primary Database: PostgreSQL (Relational Database) for structured data, reliability, and complex queries.

Provider: Supabase or Neon for managed PostgreSQL with easy integration.

State Management:
Global State: Zustand or React Context API for managing application-wide state (e.g., user session, notifications).

Deployment:
Frontend: Vercel for seamless deployment of Next.js applications, offering automatic scaling and CI/CD.

Backend Functions: Vercel (for Next.js API Routes) or AWS Lambda (for standalone Node.js functions).

Database: Supabase or Neon (managed services).

Code Quality & Tooling:
Code Formatter: Prettier for consistent code styling.

Linter: ESLint with recommended React and TypeScript configurations for identifying code issues and enforcing best practices.

8. Development Workflow & Best Practices üõ†Ô∏è
Version Control: Git and GitHub for collaborative development.

Branching Strategy: Use a main branch for production-ready code, develop for ongoing integration, and feature branches for new development.

Pull Requests (PRs): All code changes should go through PRs, requiring at least one review.

Code Reviews: Emphasize thorough code reviews for quality, maintainability, and security.

Linting & Formatting: Enforce ESLint and Prettier using Husky pre-commit hooks.

Testing: Implement unit tests for critical functions and components, and integration tests for key workflows.

Documentation: Maintain clear documentation for setup, API endpoints, and complex logic.

Issue Tracking: Utilize GitHub Issues or a tool like Linear (as mentioned previously) for tracking tasks, bugs, and features.

9. Missing Key Elements (Non-Code for Complete Startup) üìà
While the website is crucial, a successful startup also requires these elements.

Brand Identity: Comprehensive brand guidelines, consistent visuals, and messaging across all platforms (website, social media, Discord).

Legal & Compliance: Formal business registration, legal counsel, and robust privacy policies/terms of service (beyond basic templates). This includes clarity on IP ownership for Quest contributions.

Marketing & Growth Strategy: Ongoing execution of the detailed marketing plan for both Adventurer acquisition and Quest Giver sourcing.

Community Management Team: Dedicated individuals (or a growing team) to actively nurture the Discord community, onboard new members, and facilitate mentorship.

Financial Operations: Systems for invoicing, payment processing (for commissions), and Adventurer payouts.

Customer Support: A system (e.g., Zendesk, as discussed) for handling user inquiries, technical issues, and disputes effectively.

Feedback Loops: Continuous collection and analysis of feedback from both Adventurers and Quest Givers to inform product development and operations.

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building The Adventurers Guild, detailing the technical aspects, feature sets, and crucial non-code elements required for a complete and thriving startup.
